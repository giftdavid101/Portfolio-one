               My name is Gift David. I am a web developer. I create
               interactive and responsive website that will best represent
               your business for clients and partners. I use pure Html, Css,
               Javascript and React Js.
               I prefer to work as a frelancer(self-employed) and also do not mind working
               in an office.
